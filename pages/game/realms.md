# Realms

> Realm Lords are the key players in the on-chain, eternal world, they own the land and are responsible for expanding the economy of the world. They engage in wars and form alliances, and also break them, all in pursuit of scarce resources. These actions keep the game dynamic and add depth to the players' experience, as they must make strategic decisions in order to succeed. In order to be successful, Realm Lords must balance the need for resources and expansion with the need to protect their Realm and build a powerful army. They must also carefully consider their alliances and enemies, as these relationships can greatly impact their ability to acquire resources and defend their Realm.

## Origin

The 8000 Realms in the game were originally procedurally generated as black and white SVG files, but have since undergone a transition to high-fidelity 3D renders using height maps.

## 4 Traits

Each Realm has a unique number of geographical traits: 
- Cities (max 21) 
- Regions (max 7)
- Harbors (max 35)
- Rivers (max 60)

These traits play a vital role in constraining what can be built on each Realm. 

(**Cities** x **Regions**) + 25 = the amount of spatial area the Realm can build on (military buildings, work huts, storehouses etc).

**Harbors** = the number of Fishing Traps that can be built.

**Rivers** = the number of Farms that can be built.
