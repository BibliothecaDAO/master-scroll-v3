# $LORDS Reward

> $LORDS serves as the primary currency within Realms Eternum and beyond, functioning as the medium of exchange in the in-game Automated Market Maker (AMM). This requires players to purchase resources with, or sell resources for, $LORDS. To obtain this currency, players have two main options: they can either buy $LORDS for use in the game or earn them as rewards for active participation and engagement within the game. This currency system fosters a dynamic economy, incentivizing players to interact with one another and contribute to the overall richness of the gaming experience.

Each Realm regardless of rarity and traits is entitled to a $LORDS reward, but there are no free lunches.

Previously, we experimented with the mechanic of Goblin Towns, which needed to be routinely defeated by an attacking army to claim a daily $LORDS prize. Upon testing this system we discovered it did not work in balancing the game. 

A system is currently being built that will reward activity and engagement in the game.

This section will be updated soon with more information. 


The $LORDS reward will be dynamic, relative to the growth of the protocol, and will decrease over time after every epoch.
