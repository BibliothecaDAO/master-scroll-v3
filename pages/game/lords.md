# $LORDS Reward

Each Realm regardless of rarity and traits is entitled to a $LORDS reward, but there are no free lunches.

Previously we experimented with the mechanic of Goblin Towns, which needed to be routinely defeated by an attacking army to claim a daily $LORDS prize. Upon testing this system we discovered it did not work in balancing the game. 

A system is currently being built that will reward activity and engagement in the game.

This section will be updated soon with more information.
