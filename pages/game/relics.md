# Relics

---

>Across the Realms Universe, 8000 ancient relics can be found, with one relic present in each Realm. These valuable and potent artifacts can bestow substantial benefits upon a Realm. As a result, it is crucial for a Realm Lord to safeguard their territory, as failing to do so may lead to the relic's theft by another Realm. Successfully raiding a Realm allows the attacker to seize 25% of the targeted Realm's vault resources as well as the ancient relic. The loss of a relic can considerably debilitate a Realm, adversely affecting its economy and overall strength.

### What are relics?

Each Realm has a unique relic which it must protect. The relic is considered sacred and is deeply ingrained in the culture of the people of the Realm. They worship this relic, and if it is lost, they start to lose faith in their leader's ability to protect the Realm. Losing a relic can have serious consequences, not only on the Realm's economy and military power, but also on the morale of the population. 

### How do you capture a relic?

A Realm Lord can acquire a relic by successfully raiding another Realm, along with the resources obtained in a successful raid. Once a relic is plundered, it will exist on the attacking Realm until the original owner successfully raids back and reclaims it. This can provide an incentive for retaliation, as the loss of a relic can have a significant impact on a Realm.

Losing a relic can also affect the happiness rating of the population by -12 points, which can lead to a loss of morale and loyalty.

To protect their valuable relic, it is wise for a Realm Lord to build a strong defensive army and to prioritize the defense of the relic. This can help protect the Realm from raids and prevent the loss of the relic, maintaining the Realm's reputation and leadership.
