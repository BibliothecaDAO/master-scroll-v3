# Raiding

> Raiding is a key aspect of a Realm Lord's gameplay, it can provide a profitable way to gather resources when done strategically. However, it is important to be aware that raiding can also provoke other powerful players, and they may retaliate by raiding your own realm. It is essential to weigh the potential benefits and risks of raiding before making the decision. A successful raid can provide much-needed resources, but a failed raid can result in the loss of troops and resources. It is advisable to carefully plan out the raid, consider the target's defenses, and have a solid plan for retreat in case of failure.

## Pillaging a Realm

Once a Realm has summoned an attacking army, they are able to travel to another Realm of a different order and attempt to pillage it for resources. This process is called raiding. If the raid is successful, the attacking army will steal 25% of the targeted Realm's vault resources. 

However, it is important to note that raiding can be a risky strategy as the defending Realm may have a powerful army and defenses, and the raid may fail resulting in losses for the attacking army. Additionally, successfully raiding another Realm can provoke retaliation from the targeted Realm or other powerful players.

## Raiding factors to consider

### Travel

To raid another Realm for resources and relics, players must have at least one attacking army, select a target Realm (filtered by desired resources and size of the raidable vault), and action their army to travel there. 

Travel time is relevant to the distance between the coordinates of the army and the target Realm, and takes between 1-20 hours. This is displayed as a countdown timer on the army and their travel progress is also shown on the Atlas in the form of a route path. 

Once the attacking army has reached the destination, players have the choice to raid them straight away or bide their time while the raidable vault increases. Be warned though; another attacking army could plunder if youâ€™re too slow.

#### XY Coordinates

Every point of interest on the Atlas (Realms, Crypts & Caverns, Loot Bags, Armies and soon-to-be Adventurers) has XY coordinates. This adds an extra level of realism to the world of Eternum - there is a relative distance between points on the Atlas so players are required to travel to explore and interact. 

### Cool Down Time

To limit bots, there is a cool down period between raids. After a successful or unsuccessful raid, the defensive army will have a cool down period of 2hrs before it can be attacked again.

### More Army = More food consumption

The size of a Realm's standing army directly impacts the rate of population consumption. A large standing army requires a significant amount of food to sustain (1:1), and if a Realm is unable to provide enough food, the population may slip into starvation. This can have serious consequences, as it can cause the Realm's battalions to desert. Every 12 hours (the game tick cycle), the battalions will lose 15% of their health, and this will continue until they are eventually fully deserted.

Each battalion consumes 1 food per second, so the food consumption rate for a Realm's standing army can add up quickly. For example, a Realm with 3 full armies will consume 90 food per second!
