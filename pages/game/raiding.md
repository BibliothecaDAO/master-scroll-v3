# Raiding

> Raiding is a key aspect of a Realm Lord's game play, it can provide a profitable way to gather resources when done strategically. However, it is important to be aware that raiding can also provoke other powerful players, and they may retaliate by raiding your own realm. It is essential to weigh the potential benefits and risks of raiding before making the decision. A successful raid can provide much-needed resources, but a failed raid can result in the loss of troops and resources. It is advisable to carefully plan out the raid, consider the target's defenses, and have a solid plan for retreat in case of failure.

## Pillaging a Realm

Once a Realm has summoned an attacking army, they are able to travel to another Realm of a different order and attempt to pillage it for resources. This process is called raiding. If the raid is successful, the attacking army will steal 25% of the targeted Realm's vault resources. 

However, it is important to note that raiding can be a risky strategy as the defending Realm may have a powerful army and defenses, and the raid may fail resulting in losses for the attacking army. Additionally, successfully raiding another Realm can provoke retaliation from the targeted Realm or other powerful players.

## Raiding factors to consider

### Cool Down Time

To limit bots, there is a cool down period between raids. After a successful or unsuccessful raid, the defensive army will have a cool down period of 2hrs before it can be attacked again.

### More Army = More food consumption

The size of a Realm's standing army directly impacts the rate of population consumption. A large standing army requires a significant amount of food to sustain (1:1), and if a Realm is unable to provide enough food, the population may slip into starvation. This can have serious consequences, as it can cause the Realm's battalions to desert. Every 12 hours (the game tick cycle), the battalions will lose 15% of their health, and this will continue until they are eventually fully deserted.

Each battalion consumes 1 food per second, so the food consumption rate for a Realm's standing army can add up quickly. For example, a Realm with 3 full armies will consume 90 food per second!
