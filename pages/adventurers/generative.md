# Generative AI

BibliothecaDAO has been utilizing text-to-image (text-2-img) technology since the organization's inception. Through ongoing development, the team has made significant advancements in the technology. The use of tools such as MidJourney has enabled the rapid generation of deep and relatable unique character profiles.

However, this approach poses a challenge in terms of image uniqueness. To address this issue, BibliothecaDAO has implemented a strategy of training proprietary text-2-img models incorporating a distinct "flavor" to differentiate the generated images from those produced by other text-to-image models.

### Unique Adventurers PFPs

The proprietary model will be utilized to mint and attach a unique PFP for each Adventurer. This model of course - will be open source.
