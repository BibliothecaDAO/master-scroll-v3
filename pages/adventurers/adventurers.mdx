# Realms: Adventurers

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘¾">
  Information in this document will evolve as the protocol evolves. This is the
  second iteration of Adventurers design. We have taken lessons learnt from
  building Eternum and are applying them to Adventurers.

### Play To Die

Realms: Adventurers is on-chain gaming protocol design. It contains an economic loop to incentivise developers to build, whilst providing a way for players to experience the next-generation of agency and ownership in gaming.

Realms: Eternum requires a Realm to play, Realms: Adventurers will not require a Realm. To particpate in this you will only need an Adventurer.

## What is an Adventurer?

Adventurers are the characters in this reality. At the blockchain layer they are NFTS with on-chain metadata, at the application layer they are your identity and record of what you do.

### What will an Adventurer cost?

The cost of minting an Adventurer will be around $10 USD. We use a novel 

### On-chain metadata

Adventurers all start with a base layer of statistics. These statistics level up as time goes by depending on the types of activity the Adventurer completes. The modular architecture of the Adventurer contract will allow for new statistics and new activities (both from within Realms and the wider ecosystem) to be added over time.

## What do you do with an Adventurer?

### Realms

Since everything we do is on-chain

### Crafting

A key component of the Realmverse is crafting, and anyone with an Adventurer is eligible for it. This is the topic of the next section - [Loot Fountains](./loot-fountains.md).

### Interoperability with new modules

The open nature of the protocol allows new developers to build experiences for the Adventurers, so the possible utility for the Adventurers is limited only by the imagination of developers.
