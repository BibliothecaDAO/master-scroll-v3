# Play 2 Die

Because Play 2 Earn is one sided.

### Why an on-chain protocol?

App stores, such as the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, have become extremely profitable due to the network effect they possess. The network effect, in this case, is the phenomenon where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. As the number of users on one side of the marketplace increases, the number of developers on the other side also increases, creating a virtuous cycle.

If we take the idea of an app store and it's virtuous cycle and inject an element of decentralization, we can create a new type of marketplace that is fairer and more equitable. This is the idea behind Play 2 Die.

### A decentralized app store

Realms: Adventurers can be seen as a decentralized app store like experience, with a catch. There is no gating, no approval process, no predatory fees and no servers to maintain. The apps that exist within Play 2 Die are just smart contracts running on a decentralised blockchain. This means that the only cost to the developer is the cost of deploying the smart contract. Once deployed - as long as players keep playing, developers keep getting paid!

Players can take their characters from game to game and spend their credits ($LORDS) in playing.
