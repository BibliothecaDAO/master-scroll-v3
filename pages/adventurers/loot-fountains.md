# Inflation: Loot Fountains

`ðŸ’¡ Layer 1 = Persistence data layer`

`ðŸ’¡ Layer 2 = Computation`

To make Loot a valuable game asset, it needs to be dynamic and accessible to more players. The strategy is to use an inflationary distillation contract that breaks down each Loot bag into individual items, which can then be traded and used on StarkNet. Controlled inflation will help balance the contract and allow for the next 100k players to access Loot.

### Controlled inflation

Inflation is a natural phenomenon in the world as more energy is injected into ecosystems. Loot is no different. There are 8,000 Loot bags with a total of 64,000 items.

This process would look something like this:

### Item Flow

1. Items are distilled into individual ERC721s directly onto StarkNet in the holder's account
2. Items are available to trade, use in games, or equip on an Adventurer

### Inflation Rate

The actual inflation rate will be finalized on a vote by the hybrid DAO, however, our proposal is as follows:

- 1 Distil event per 604,800s (1 Week)
- 25 $LORDS to distil a bag

If 2,000 bags are distilled each week, this will equate to ~16,000 items which allow the equipping of potentially 2,000 Adventurers. Although it is highly doubtful that all 2000 would be assembled.

### Item Statistics

Each item will have its own set of dynamic statistics that will evolve with usage.

### Equipping Items

Adventurers will be able to equip these items in any combination that suits them best.

### The Merchant Contract

A merchant will be a buy-back contract where users can go to burn their unwanted items. In exchange for the burn, the players will receive a combination of resources and or $LORDS back. This will aim to provide a lever to control the supply of items into the marketplace. The specifics of this will be explained closer to launch.
