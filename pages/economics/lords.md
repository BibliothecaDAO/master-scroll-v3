# The Lords Token

The $LORDS token is the ERC20 token that powers the Realmverse. It serves as a fungible method for entry and exit from the network, and is essential for gameplay. The token follows a long emission schedule, which is controlled by the growth of the network. This means that the token will be released over a prolonged period of time, rather than all at once. 

The release schedule is designed to align the token's supply with the demand for the network's resources and services. This helps to ensure that the token's value is stable, and that it can be used as a reliable method of exchange within the Realmverse. The $LORDS token can be used to purchase resources, summon armies, and build structures, among other things. Additionally, the token can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges, allowing players to enter and exit the network as they see fit.

The total supply of $LORDS tokens is capped at 500 million, and the distribution of these tokens is governed by the Bibliotheca DAO.

## Allocations

### Game emissions

The biggest tranche of $LORDS will be released via game emissions. These emissions will follow a supply curve dependent on the actions within the game. It will be released at a sustained rate to balance inflation with growth, with the expected total distribution to take at least 7 years.

### Bibliotheca DAO

The DAO retains a large proportion of the tokens which it could choose to use for any purpose.

### Development Fund

5% of $LORDS is allocated to the first development fund used to build the original game.

### Journey Contract

The journey contract was the initial distribution of $LORDS to early Realms holders who chose to stake. An allocation of this size will not happen again.
