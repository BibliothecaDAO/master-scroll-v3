# Tokens

## The Open Item Table

The project is built on a foundation of composable, DAO-governed contracts that can be extended in the future through the addition of modules and updates to the core item table contracts.


## ERC20 (Fungible)

### $LORDS

The $LORDS token is an ERC-20 token that is unique to the network. It is generated from specific assets within the system and is essential for the functioning of the network. To participate in trading on the Automated Market Maker (AMM), it is necessary to use $LORDS tokens.


## ERC1155 (Semi-fungibles)

### Resources

Resources are the core fungible tokens in the network. They can only be generated via in-game non-fungible token (NFT) assets and are at the center of the game world. Resources are used to pay for buildings constructed on a Realm, and in the process, they are destroyed. This results in them being highly inflationary and highly deflationary according to their utilization within the network.

In the first game release, 22 different tokens will exist and they will be generated from the Realms settled in the game. New resources will be added as the game progresses, with the first expansion coming from the Crypts & Caverns NFTs.

## ERC721 (NFTS)

### Realms

Realms exist within this world as tradable NFTs on the [Marketplace](./nft-marketplace.md). You will be able to sell settled Realms (without unsettling) via the L2 Marketplace.


### Loot items

We have developed an inflationary distillation contract of individual Loot items with a special Layer 1 to Layer 2 function. These inflate at a fixed rate and are available for trade and to equip onto their Adventurer.

Balancing a game where external developers can submit core modules that affect the economy is a known and accepted challenge. After the game is launched there will be a balancing committee of builders who will vote on how each new resource/item interoperates with the rest of the game.
