# Tokens

## The Open Item Table

The project is designed around a core set of composable DAO governed contracts, extendable in the future via modules and upgrading of the core item table contracts. 


## ERC20 (Fungible)

### $LORDS

$LORDS is the only erc20 token within the network. It is generated only from specific assets within the world and is crucial to the network. You must use $LORDS in order to trade on the AMM. 


## ERC1155 (Semi-fungibles)

### Resources

Resources are the core fungible tokens in the network. They can only be generated via in game NFT assets and are at the center of this whole world. Resources are used to pay for buildings constructed on a Realm, and in the process, they are burnt. Due to this, they are highly inflationary and highly deflationary according to their utilization within the network.


In the first game release, 22 different tokens will exist and they will generate from the Realms settled in the game. New resources will be added as the game progresses, with the first expansion coming from the Crypts & Caverns NFTs.


## ERC721 (NFTS)

### Realms

Realms exist within this world as tradable NFTs on the [Marketplace](./nft-marketplace.md). You will be able to sell settled Realms (without unsettling) via the L2 Marketplace.


### Loot items

We have developed an inflationary distillation contract of individual Loot items with a special Layer 1 to Layer 2 function. These inflate at a fixed rate and are available for trade and to equip onto their Adventurer.

Balancing a game where external developers can submit core modules that affect the economy is a known and accepted challenge. After the game is launched there will be a balancing committee of builders who will vote on how each new resource/item interoperates with the rest of the game.
